A Proposal for a Language Of Geometry
=====================================

Stuff will be written here someday. In the meantime, check out the code folder, and its "whitePaper.md", to get a rough idea of what is going on.

Otherwise, I should keep a fairly up to date version [here](http://www.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/~msableme/LoG/)

What you need to build this
---------------------------

Mainly:
* `ocaml`
* `opam` then all the dependencies until building works (mainly,
    js_of_ocaml, lwt, ocamlfind, ???)
* `pandoc` - Note that a recent enough version is required as I'm using the
  recently added `--syntax-definition=` option.
